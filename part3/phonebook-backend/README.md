All course materials for "The Phonebook" exercises **3.1.–3.22.** are located inside the `phonebook-backend` folder.

## ✅ Exercises Overview

During the development of the project in Part 3, the following tasks were performed.

### 3.1: Phonebook backend, step 1

- Implemented a REST API that returns a hardcoded list of phonebook entries at `http://localhost:3001/api/persons`.

### 3.2: Phonebook backend, step 2

- Added `/info` route which displays the number of entries in the phonebook and the current server timestamp.

### 3.3: Phonebook backend, step 3

- Implemented a route GET `/api/persons/:id` to fetch a single entry by ID.
- Returns 404 if the person is not found.

### 3.4: Phonebook backend, step 4

- Added DELETE functionality at DELETE `/api/persons/:id`.
- Tested with Postman.

### 3.5: Phonebook backend, step 5

- Enabled adding new persons using POST `/api/persons`.
- Used `Math.random()` to generate unique IDs.

### 3.6: Phonebook backend, step 6

- Added error handling:
  - Returns 400 if name or number is missing.
  - Returns 400 if the name already exists.

### 3.7: Phonebook backend, step 7

- Integrated Morgan middleware with `tiny` configuration for logging.

### 3.8: Phonebook backend, step 8

- Extended Morgan to log POST request body data using custom tokens and `JSON.stringify()`.

### 3.9: Phonebook backend, step 9

- Integrated frontend with the backend.
- Adjusted API endpoints in the frontend to match backend routes.

### 3.10: Phonebook backend, step 10

- Deployed backend to Render.
- Created a `README.md` with the deployment link.

### 3.11: Full Stack Phonebook

- Built frontend production bundle.
- Served the frontend from the backend's dist directory.

### 3.12: Command-line database

- Created `mongo.js` to interact with MongoDB Atlas:
  - Add new person with name and number.
  - List all persons.
- Handled proper database connection closing.

### 3.13: Phonebook database, step 1

- Fetched all persons from MongoDB using Mongoose.

### 3.14: Phonebook database, step 2

- Enabled saving new entries to the database.

### 3.15: Phonebook database, step 3

- Allowed deletion of entries in MongoDB.

### 3.16: Phonebook database, step 4

- Moved error handling logic to a centralized error-handling middleware.

### 3.17: Phonebook database, step 5

- Supported PUT requests to update a person’s phone number if the name already exists.

### 3.18: Phonebook database, step 6

- Modified `/api/persons/:id` and `/info` to use MongoDB data.

### 3.19: Phonebook database, step 7

- Added validation: names must be at least 3 characters long.
- Frontend displays error messages on validation failure.

### 3.20: Phonebook database, step 8

- Validated phone numbers:
  - At least 8 characters long.
  - Two parts separated by a hyphen: first with 2-3 digits, second with rest.

## 🧠 Notes

- Ensure unique IDs for each contact.
- Use appropriate `key` props when rendering lists.
- Handle errors gracefully using try/catch or `.catch()`.
- Notification messages are styled by success (green) or error (red) status.
- Backend responses are expected in JSON format.
