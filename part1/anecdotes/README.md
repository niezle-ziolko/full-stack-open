All course materials for "Anecdotes" exercises **1.11.–1.14.** are located inside the `anecdotes` folder.

## ✅ Exercises Overview

This project builds an interactive anecdote voting application using React and state management with hooks. It progresses across three exercises:

### 1.12: Anecdotes, step 1

- Initialized a new Vite project for the anecdotes application.
- Implemented logic to display a random anecdote from a predefined list.
- Added a "next anecdote" button to randomly select a different anecdote using Math.random().

### 1.13: Anecdotes, step 2

- Introduced voting functionality for each anecdote.
- Stored votes in an array inside the component’s state.
- Implemented correct state updates using the array copy pattern with the spread operator.
- Displayed the number of votes for the currently shown anecdote.

### 1.14: Anecdotes, step 3

- Implemented logic to track and display the anecdote with the highest number of votes.
- Displayed both the most voted anecdote and its vote count.
- In case of a tie, the first highest-voted anecdote found is shown (as per exercise instructions).
